       "'To run Kafka, you need to follow these steps based on your scripts:\\n\\n1. Make sure your Kafka broker is running. You can confirm this by running `docker ps`. If the broker is not active, navigate to the folder with your docker-compose yaml file and run `docker compose up -d` to start all instances.\\n\\n2. In your project directory, to run the producer, use the following command:\\n   ```\\n   java -cp build/libs/<jar_name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:out src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Ensure that the `StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG` in your Java scripts (e.g., JsonProducer.java, JsonConsumer.java) is set to the correct server URL. Also, verify that the cluster key and secrets in `src/main/java/org/example/Secrets.java` are updated with the correct values.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run Kafka successfully.'"
